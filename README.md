# ALAB 316.3.1: DOM Manipulation (Part Two)
                                        Introduction
This lab is the second of a two-part assignment in which you will manipulate the DOM using various tools and techniques. This portion of the activity focuses on making elements dynamic and interactive using DOM events and event-driven programming techniques

Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript and DOM events.
                                        Instructions
You will begin with a copy of the CodeSandbox you used for ALAB 316.1.1 - DOM Manipulation (Part One). Fork that CodeSandbox, and rename it to indicate that this is Part Two of the lab.
Do not modify any of the contents of the index.html or styles.css files. Your goal in this lab is to demonstrate DOM manipulation through JavaScript, so directly modifying the HTML or CSS files is counterproductive.

                                    Part 1: Getting Started
Take a few moments to explore your code and refamiliarize yourself with it. Now that you have a deeper understanding of DOM manipulation concepts, if there is anything you would like to fix or change, now is the time to do so.
                                    Part 2: Adding Additional HTML and CSS
One of the most important features of an interactive user interface is feedback. The user needs to know that their actions are accomplishing something, even if it is something as simple as a button shifting color slightly or changing the cursor style when hovered, indicating that it is clickable.
                                    Part 3: Creating the Submenu
A submenu serves as an additional menu for users to select from, and offers more specific context to the top-level menu's options. We will start by using some DOM manipulation techniques to format the submenu before adding interaction to each menu component.

                        All future steps should be completed within the index.js file.
1-Select and cache the <nav id="sub-menu"> element in a variable named subMenuEl.
2-Set the height subMenuEl element to be "100%".
3-Set the background color of subMenuEl to the value stored in the --sub-menu-bg CSS custom property.
4- Add the class of flex-around to the subMenuEl element.
5-Set the CSS position property of subMenuEl to the value of absolute.
6-Set the CSS top property of subMenuEl to the value of 0.
